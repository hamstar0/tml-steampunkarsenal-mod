# Spirit Walking

Implements a new form of movement: Spirit Walking. Activated by way of a Shadow Mirror, this mode lets you travel around the world in free flight, automatically propelled in the direction you aim in. Monsters and projectiles cannot harm you, but collision with world obstacles can interrupt your Walk. Spirit Walking uses mana, but you can recover (or lose) mana during a Walk, if you're nimble.
