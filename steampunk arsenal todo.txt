-	Implement steam fx
	-	Add boiler steam + vibrations
	-	Add steam spout on firing rivet
	-	Refine steam malfunction burst
-	@Test
-	Add gauge water reading


-	Set default water temperature to 1f + remove concept of CapacityUsed
-	Implement 'Steam Ball' ammo item
	-	Create sprite
	-	Implement automatic recharging (via. ConvergentBoiler)
	-	Implement gun charging + consume charge
	-	Recipe: 1 Magitech Scrap, 1 Inlet Pump, 5 Iron/Lead Bars, 5 Copper/Tin Bars, 1 Lava Bucket
	-	Define item
-	Implement SteamSource and SteamBall logic classes
-	Implement 'Port-A-Boiler' accessory
	-	Recipe: 1 Boiler-O-Burden, 1 Inlet Pump, 1 Outlet Pump, 5 Hellstone Bars
	-	Implement temperature and pressure (also gun charging, by extension)
	-	Define item
	-	Create sprite
-	Create gun sprite
-	Implement boiler capacity
-	Change boiler to use 2 separate heat indicators (also for ConvergentBoiler)
-	Implement boiler water auto-fill
	-	Add sound fx (Liquid_1)
	-	Implement auto-fill
-	Fix gauge
-	Implement steam gauge widget (via. HUD Elements Lib)
	-	Implement fuel adding
		-	Emit sound when fuel added (i:111, 95)
		-	Consume gels to increase fuel
	-	Add fuel button (Main.hasFocus = true)
	-	Define widget
	-	Create graphics
-	Implement 'Boiler-O-Burden' chest armor
	-	Recipe: 10 Iron/Lead Bars, 10 Copper/Tin Bars, 1 Rocket Boots
	-	Transfer boiler value to equipping player's "boiler"
	-	Define item
	-	Create sprite
	-	@Plan
		-	Boiler's temperature is controlled by how many gels are fed into the device
		-	If the temperature becomes too high, the boiler scalds the weilder
		-	The higher the temperature, the faster the boiler charges things that use it
-	Change pin effect to direct damage for certain ai styles (e.g. multi-point npcs or bosses)
-	Fix pin squirm behavior
-	Fix pin behavior (teleports monsters after pin expires?)
-	Finish implementing gun charge behavior
	-	Verify charge behavior
	-	Implement cheaty player boiler (temporary)
	-	Show primitive steam gauge (temporary)
	-	Prevent firing gun without a charge (includes alerts)
-	Implement projectile
	-	Ensure pinning is synced
	-	Implement multiple pinning rivets per NPC
	-	Implement NPC pinning
		-	Implement pin 'struggle' behavior
		-	Implement pin enforcement
		-	Implement pin placement
		-	Implement pin assigning
	-	Create sprite + fx
	-	Define projectile
	-	@Plan
		-	If an NPC is hit and is near the terrain the bolt hits, they become pinned in place
		-	NPC attempted velocity causes damage, but also damages the rivet
		-	If rivet runs out of hp, NPC is freed
-	Implement steam backfire behavior
	-	Implement fx (steam 11, 61) (smoke 99, 376, 435) (sulfur 220) (big 862)
	-	Implement pain
-	Implement gun
	-	Implement fire behavior
	-	Define charge behavior
	-	Define item
